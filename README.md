Binding of Isaac 4 Souls created by Edmund McMillen and Published by Maestro Media
<br> 4 Souls BINGO created by Craig Kimball who does not own any of the rights nor asked for any permissions, so please do not sue me :(
## A brand new way to play Binding of Isaac Four Souls!!!
The goal of the game is no longer to be the first player to obtain 4 souls cards, instead the first player to make BINGO wins!
<br> <br> Like BINGO, 4SoulsBINGO consists of a 5 x 5 board. Each square on the board is a different win condition. These conditions vary from easy to hard to goofy. The first player to connect 5 squares in a row wins.

## How to Use
This project is a work in progress and as of 8/23/23 it can only be run in a Java Runtime Environment. To generate a new board, simply install the files and run the window.java program.

## ToDo List
The endgame of this project is to end up mobile devices for ease of access and user friendliness. Future features will include: <br>
Squares will be replaced by buttons which will change colors to mark which conditions have been met <br>
A "Shuffle" button, which easily randomizes a new board <br>
A "Clear" button which unmarks all met conditions <br>
A "Share" button which will share your boards with friends <br>
And possibly more! Who knows!
